                       My name is Hitesh Motwani, and I am from Arvi, Maharashtra. I completed my graduation in BSc.
                        from Amravati University in 2021. Subsequently, I undertook a Python development course, which 
                        included an internship and a finite project on data science. After that, I joined a backend web
                         development bootcamp where I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, API, and MongoDB 
                         database skills. I successfully completed four real-life projects during the bootcamp. Following the
                          bootcamp, I received two months of mentorship to further polish my skills before taking up the role of
                           a part-time full-stack mentor at the 10X IT Institute.<br>

                      Now, coming to my achievements, I have participated in badminton tournaments at the division level 
                      twice and have also won a bronze medal at the taluka level.

                <h4>Web Developer Mentor</h4>
                <p>
                    During my time as a part-time web developer mentor, I had the opportunity to guide and support aspiring web developers 
                    in their learning journey. It was incredibly fulfilling to share my knowledge and expertise with them, helping them 
                    understand complex concepts and master various programming languages and frameworks. Witnessing their growth and progress
                     was truly rewarding, as I saw them develop their skills and build impressive projects. I also enjoyed fostering a 
                     collaborative and supportive environment, encouraging them to explore new ideas and problem-solving techniques. 
                     The experience taught me the importance of effective communication and adaptability, as I tailored my mentoring approach
                      to suit each individual's unique learning style. Overall, being a web developer mentor allowed me to make a positive
                       impact on others' lives while continuously enhancing my own skills as a developer.

                    During my time as a part-time web developer intern, I gained valuable hands-on experience in designing and 
                    developing websites. Collaborating with the development team, I was involved in various stages of the web 
                    development process, including requirement analysis, coding, and testing. I had the opportunity to work on 
                    real-world projects, enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive web design. I actively
                     participated in team meetings and contributed innovative ideas to improve user experience and functionality.
                      This internship allowed me to sharpen my problem-solving abilities and provided a solid foundation for my future
